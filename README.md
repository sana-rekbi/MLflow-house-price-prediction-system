# MLflow-house-price-prediction-system

This repository contains code and resources for an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting house prices. The project covers all stages of a typical machine learning workflow, from data exploration to deployment using MLOps tools.

## Topics Covered

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform thorough EDA to derive insights about housing market trends and understand data patterns like location, square footage, and amenities.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineer features to improve model performance, including scaling, encoding categorical features (e.g., neighborhood), and transforming numerical features (e.g., log transformation of house prices).
- **Model Training and Validation**: Train various machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to predict house prices. Validate models using cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards of code quality by using design patterns and writing scalable, defensive, and readable code.
- **MLOps Integration**: Use tools like ZenML and MLflow for experiment tracking, versioning, and deploying the trained model.
